## Edge AIBench V2.0
**The Edge AIBench V2.0 is a benchmarking tool for Edge AIBench systems**

The Edge AIBench V2.0 includes 4 workloads

No1: The *object detection* task uses YOLOv5 as the deep learning network model and selected BDD100K as the
dataset, which contains 100,000 labeled HD datasets.

No2:The *traffic light classification* task uses a CNN model as the deep learning network model. It uses the Nexar dataset as the real-world dataset, which contains 18,659 abeled training datasets containing traffic signal images and 500,000 test data images.

No3:The *road sign classification* task uses a CNN deep learning model based on the LeNet framework and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTRB) as the dataset, and the task classifies 43 classes of traffic signs.

No4:
